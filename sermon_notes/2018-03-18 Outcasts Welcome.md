# Outcasts Welcome

Sometimes we give a reason for unbelievers to look at us and think that we are self-righteous hypocritical "church goers"
David welcomed the outcasts b/c he felt like one of them, he had to hide in a cave.

**Pt 1.** We (as the church) are all weak unworthy outcasts brought together because we need a redeemer. We have seen our poverty and cry out for help.

God did not choose the wise, but the foolish.

Christ came for sinners, and thats who we are. It's not b/c I am a little bit smarter that I'm in church today.

It doesn't matter how bad they were, past tense, or how bad they are, present tense. They are welcomed to our church. In love we will point them to the truth of God and reformation.

**Pt 2.** David is determined to have continual praise. He doesn't wallow in pity, he blesses the Lord at all times.

**Pt 3.** David's praise is contagious, he encourages others to magnify the Lord with him.

Paul -- no matter what happens, Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or death. Phil 1:20-21

This is the vibe that we must give to the world -- it's not that we're better than you, we have been saved by grace. **How do we do that practically?**

**How does this change us?** We show compassion and welcome and love to all people, inviting them to be apart of what we have here.

**How do we maintain this view of ourselves?** Be in the Word continually, be apart of a community that also believes this.

**What are evidences we aren't seeing ourselves properly?** We judge others within the church negatively.
