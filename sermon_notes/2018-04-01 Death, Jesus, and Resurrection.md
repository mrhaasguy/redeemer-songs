# Death, Jesus, and Resurrection
## Hebrews 2;9, 14-16; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, 20-27, 54-57


### Death - A tool of Terror in the Hands of the Devil.
We are all afraid of death.
Why? **Why are we so afraid of death?**

It isn't just a fear for older or sick people, death is a "lifelong slavery"

The devil slipped death into the realm of human existence.

### Death - A tool of Destruction and Deliverance in the Hands of Jesus

Why did Jesus become a man? To die. Divinity could not die.

For Jesus, death was a tool to accomplish His purpose (defeating the devil and death)
Jesus defeats the devil with his own weapon. He "destroys" (renders inoperative) the work of the devil.

Death has no claims on a non-sinner. When Jesus dies for us, he undoes that sentence of death for us. He now holds the keys of death and hell.

### Death - Abolished by the Resurrection of Jesus

Jesus didn't just die a physical death on the cross, but He also suffered eternal death, hell, the full price for the punishment of our sins.

Jesus' resurrection demonstrates that our sins are fully paid for, and that the sacrifice has been accepted by God.

Sin and death no longer reigns.

When the day of resurrection comes, we will be raised just because Christ was raised.

Who would have thought that by dying, Jesus would have accomplished his greatest victory? Jesus's death abolishes death.

Death isn't quicksand, sinking into eternal hell, but a trampoline, bouncing you into heaven.

Why do we still physically die? Because it hasn't taken effect yet, there is a future effective date.
