# Our Compassionate God
## Matthew 9:35-38

1. We want to be a church focused on mission.
2. Also, we want to be a church focused on ***global*** mission.

### Mission because ... God is a compassionate God.

*Compassion* = deep sympathy + desire to help

Jesus shows us the compassion of God by healing every disease and fixing every affliction around him, and teaching truth and proclaiming the good news.

The compassion of God moves us to mission.

### Mission because ... We are a harassed, helpless, and wandering people w/o Jesus

Every person is living in a world of brokeness.

Jesus is the **good** shepherd. HE actually cares for the sheep.

"Come as you are, all are welcome" -- BUT as we come, Jesus leads us to the path of life.


### Mission because ... There is huge opportunity.

There is nothing more glorious than God coming into his broken world to restore and give life.

### Mission because ... The Plan is clear -- Pray and Point.

Mission -- pray. We can all pray.

Through prayer he will give us opportunity. Pray for more opportunity to lead peole into the care of the Good Shepherd.

### Take-aways

**Why did Jim choose to preach on this passage? Why did he choose his 4 points? What is the main message he wanted to get across?**

Compassion - desire. How do we increase it? This has to be the driving force for mission. **So, what do we do if we want more desire?**
