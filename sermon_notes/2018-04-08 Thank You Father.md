# Thank You, Father
## Colossians 1:12-13

### The Father has Qualified us
The Father is the primary cause of our salvation.

God makes us Qualified or sufficient or worthy, we are not so in and of ourselves 2 Cor. 3:6.

We are disqualified by our sin. However the Father qualifies us!

### The Father has Delivered us

From the domain of darkness. A harsh existence.

The domain of darkness, not domain of the devil. The story isn't God vs Devil, the devil is not that powerful or prominent to the the single antagonist against God.

**Ruler** of this domain -> Satan, he is the prince of darkness.

**Law** of this domain -> Evil is good and good is evil. Evil is permissible, often the pursuit or the goal.

This domain has **secure borders**. You can't just leave willy nilly.

What is the darkness?

1. The realm of **sin, anti-God**
2. The darkness speaks of **shame**, hiding. We hide from the presence of the Light.
3. The darkness speaks of **blindness**. You can't see, so you fear danger. The truth of God is hidden from them, because of their blindness.

We not only lived in darkness, we **were** darkness. We were the problem, actively believing and promoting the propaganda of the realm of darkness.

Until the Father intervened, and rescued us from this domain.

### The Father has Transferred us

To the kingdom of His Beloved Son. Not light, not the kingdom of God.

This too is a kingdom.

**Law** -> the Law of God. Truth and righteousness. Sin is against 

The King **defends** his subjects. He doesn't have to secure his borders to keep people from escaping, because they desire to be there.

This kingdom is the **land of Light**, not darkness. Everything is visible and open to inspection. You don't have to hide from God or other people.

It is a kingdom **w/o fear of consequences**. W/o fear of what others will think of you. W/o fear of what will happen to you some day.

It is a kingdom of **love**. We love the King and his subjects.

There is **no more pretending**, no masks, no distance. Where we pretend not to feel what we really feel. We don't have to pretend that we sin, or are tempted.

We **see the truth**, we are not blinded. Because there is light, there is the absence of fear, we can see where we are going. Light keeps us from fear.

What is life in the light like? 1 John 1 - We are comfortable living in holiness and the light. We have fellowship w/ one another, no more hiding/shame/guilt. And, the blood of Christ cleanses us from sin, we are forgiven/washed of sin.
